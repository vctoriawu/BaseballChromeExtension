# BaseballChromeExtension
Combining two of my greatest passions, coding and baseball, this Chrome Extension applies a baseball image to each new tab in Chrome

# Installation
Requires BeautifulSoup, runs in Python and html.

# Usage
Download all files into one folder.
The Python file contains code to webscrape and download images from an online MLB gallery.
The downloaded images store in the same folder on the local device.

Install in Chrome extension by clicking on More: and then More tools and then Extensions.
Load unpacked and select the folder containing the files.

Open a new tab and enjoy!
